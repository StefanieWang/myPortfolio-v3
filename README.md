# myPortfolio-v3

Third version of my portfolio built with HTML5, CSS3, Resoposive Design.

1. The showcase projects are designed as cards which will flip over on hover.

2. For each project card, the front side is a sreenshot of the project, and the back side will be a simple description of the project.

3. Project names are linked to relevant repositories on Github.

A good practice of the responsive design and css transition & transform skills, but still not what I like. 
I will make another one with a totally different looking.
